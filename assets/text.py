intro_title = "Oh No... Where is the kelp?"
intro_p = "The once lush kelp forest that dominated the California coast have been shrinking. Even close to our home we have seen how the kelp forest around Santa Barbara have been fading away. This is not good. The kelp forest are a vital ecosystem, climate regulator, and part of Santa Barbara's Local economy."

kelp_lose_p ="Kelp forests are not just scenic underwater ecosystems — they are critical to ocean health, climate regulation, and biodiversity. These towering algae absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, helping to mitigate climate change by sequestering CO₂ in their tissues and, when they die, transporting much of that carbon to the seafloor. According to Earth.org, kelp forests are among the fastest-growing organisms on Earth and have the potential to capture carbon at rates rivaling terrestrial forests. Their decline weakens this natural carbon sink, allowing more greenhouse gases to accumulate in the atmosphere. At the same time, kelp forests provide food and shelter for hundreds of marine species. When kelp vanishes, so do many of the animals that depend on it — from fish and invertebrates to sea otters and seals. Data collected by the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research program show steep declines in fish and invertebrate populations following kelp loss. In short, losing kelp forests doesn’t just hurt marine life — it removes one of the planet’s most powerful climate allies and erodes the foundation of coastal biodiversity."
C02 = "Depending on the species, the lifespan of kelp can vary from up to a year to longer. During that time they can grow up to two to 30 metres (98 ft) tall during their life and up to 61 centimetres (2 ft) per day. This rate of growth means more photosynthesis potential, thus carbon dioxide being absorbed to help the kelp grow. When kelp dies, the most of the carbon dioxide it has absorbed is locked up in its tissues and transported to the ocean floor. Kelps ability to grow faster in relation to land forests gives it the advantage to sequester carbon at a faster rate.  A study published in the scientific journal Nature reported kelp forests in Australia’s Great Southern Reef sequester 1.3–2.8 teragrams of carbon per year (Tg C year−1), amounting to more than 30% of total blue carbon stored and sequestered around the Australian continent, and ~ 3% of the total global blue carbon. There is great potential for kelp forests to help offset carbon emissions. According to a BBC report, globally, seaweeds (including kelp) are thought to sequester nearly 200 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year – as much as New York State’s annual emissions. Moreover, the article suggests that 48 million square kilometres of the world’s oceans are suitable for seaweed cultivation."


heat_wave = "The collapse of California’s once-thriving kelp forests can be traced back to a combination of warming oceans and ecological imbalance. In 2014, a prolonged marine heat wave—known as “The Blob”—sent ocean temperatures soaring along the Pacific coast. Warmer waters weakened kelp, making them more susceptible to disease and less capable of reproducing. At the same time, these conditions accelerated the growth and spread of purple sea urchins, which thrive in nutrient-depleted environments. Making matters worse, the sunflower sea star—a primary predator of sea urchins—was devastated by a mysterious wasting disease. Within just a few years, this keystone predator vanished from large portions of the West Coast, triggering a cascading effect that allowed purple urchin populations to explode unchecked."
sunflower_p = "Sunflower sea stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides) once roamed the seafloor in massive numbers, using their speed and sensitivity to track and consume sea urchins. Unlike most other sea stars, sunflower stars are fast-moving and voracious, capable of eating dozens of urchins in a single day. Their presence kept urchin populations in balance and prevented the formation of “urchin barrens”—desolate reef zones stripped of all kelp. With their sudden disappearance due to sea star wasting disease, an important predator-prey relationship collapsed. This allowed purple urchins to overgraze vast kelp forests, consuming even the holdfasts that anchor the kelp to the seafloor. Without the regulating force of sunflower sea stars, the ecosystem tipped out of balance, and the kelp forests that once supported rich marine life began to disappear."
main_chart_title = "California and Santa Barbara Ocean Temperatures (1982-2023)"
heatmap_title = "Santa Barbara Detailed Ocean Temperatures"

kelpVurchins = "The dramatic decline of kelp forests along the California coast is largely attributed to the overpopulation of purple sea urchins. These voracious grazers feed on kelp holdfasts—the structures anchoring kelp to the seafloor—effectively uprooting entire kelp plants. In the absence of natural predators like the sunflower sea star, whose populations have been decimated by disease, sea urchin numbers have surged. This imbalance has led to the formation of urchin barrens areas where dense aggregations of sea urchins have stripped the seafloor of kelp and other algae, leaving behind a barren landscape devoid of the rich biodiversity once supported by kelp forests. These barrens persist, as urchins can survive long periods with minimal food, hindering the natural recovery of kelp ecosystems. "
red_vs_purple = "While both red and purple sea urchins feed on kelp, it is the purple urchin that has emerged as the primary driver of kelp forest collapse along the West Coast. One key reason is human harvesting: red urchins are commercially valuable and regularly collected for their roe, known as uni, which helps keep their populations in check. In contrast, purple urchins are smaller, less desirable, and have been largely ignored by fisheries. Compounding the issue is their incredible ability to survive in harsh conditions. Unlike red urchins, purple urchins can persist for years in a starved, nearly dormant state, requiring little food and continuing to graze on any remaining kelp. When malnourished, they shrink their energy-rich gonads — the part used for reproduction and sushi — to survive, making them biologically resilient but commercially useless. These “zombie urchins” form dense aggregations called urchin barrens, which prevent kelp from regrowing and make ecosystem recovery extremely difficult without human intervention."
predators = """
        Predators play a vital role in controlling purple urchin populations, which have exploded 
        in recent years and devastated kelp forests along the California coast. One of the most 
        important predators is the sunflower sea star, a species nearly wiped out by disease. 
        Restoring this predator—via lab-bred reintroductions and habitat protections—could help 
        naturally suppress urchin overgrowth. Even now there great reports that their population is 
        recovering in areas like Alaska. But the starfish population is far from restored. 
        To support efforts of re-population one can donate or volunteer at places like the Sunflower Star Lab, 
        that helping through lab-bred reproduction. Similarly, sea otters and California sheephead are 
        crucial allies. Otters consume large numbers of urchins while sheephead crack them open with 
        powerful jaws. Maintaining and strengthening populations of these native predators will 
        reestablish a natural balance, allowing kelp to regrow without constant grazing pressure.
    """
divers = """
        In areas where predators are not yet fully recovered, human intervention can help manage 
        purple urchin outbreaks. Encouraging divers to harvest purple urchins provides both ecological 
        and economic benefits. Once considered a nuisance, these urchins are now being reconsidered 
        as a culinary delicacy known for their roe, or "uni." Programs have been launched to train 
        divers, collect urchins from barren reef zones, and fatten them up in land-based farms to 
        enhance their market value. One place this has been done is at an abalone farm near Santa Barbara, 
        named the Cultured Abalone. You can support places like The Cultured Abalone or purple urchin divers
        by being a customer of their products, incentivizing them to stay in the market.
        Well-fed urchins yield more uni and create incentives to remove 
        them sustainably from the wild. These efforts directly reduce grazing pressure on kelp and 
        make room for natural regeneration.
    """
replanting = """
        Even with predators returning and divers harvesting urchins, kelp forests often need a head 
        start to recover. Replanting initiatives, like those underway in Santa Barbara, involve 
        manually attaching kelp spores or juvenile plants to rocks in areas cleared of urchins. 
        These efforts help anchor kelp back into the ecosystem before it can be grazed down again. 
        Combined with urchin control strategies, replanting creates conditions where kelp can take 
        root and spread, restoring its crucial role as habitat, food source, and carbon sink. 
        These reforestation efforts not only bring back biodiversity but also strengthen coastal 
        resilience to warming oceans.

helping_p = "Helping kelp forests recover requires a combination of ecological restoration and community involvement. We can support efforts to remove overpopulated purple sea urchins through targeted diving programs and promote the recovery of natural predators like sunflower sea stars, sea otters, and sheephead fish. Replanting kelp in cleared areas can jumpstart regrowth, especially when combined with continued urchin control. Consumers can also make a difference by supporting sustainable seafood and restoration initiatives. With coordinated action, we can restore balance to these vital ecosystems and help kelp forests once again thrive along our coasts."
